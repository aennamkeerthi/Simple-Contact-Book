# Simple Contact Book (Python Project)

## Description
This is a **simple in-memory contact management system** built using Python.  
It allows users to **add, view, search, edit, and delete contacts** while the program is running.  
All data is stored in memory using Python **lists and dictionaries**, so contacts are **lost once the program is closed**.  

This project is perfect for beginners to practice Python fundamentals, including loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures.

## Features
- **Add Contact** – Store a new contact (name + phone number).  
- **View Contacts** – Display all saved contacts.  
- **Search Contact** – Find a contact by name (case-insensitive).  
- **Edit Contact** – Update the name or phone of an existing contact.  
- **Delete Contact** – Remove a contact from the list.  
- **Exit Program** – Close the program safely.
